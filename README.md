# 🌟 Invisio: Next-Gen Video Object Segmentation for Real-World Complexity


🔍 Introduction
Video object segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, video editing, and augmented reality. However, real-world environments introduce extreme challenges:

Occlusions (objects hidden behind others)

Dynamic backgrounds (moving cameras, changing scenery)

Poor lighting conditions (low light, shadows, glare)

Complex object interactions (crowded scenes, deformable objects)

Most existing solutions struggle with these complexities, producing fragmented or inaccurate segmentations.



# 🚀 Overview
Invisio is a cutting-edge video object segmentation system designed to accurately detect and segment objects in challenging environments with:

Heavy occlusions 🌫️

Dynamic backgrounds 🏙️

Low lighting conditions 🌘

Complex object interactions 🤹

Built using PyTorch and OpenCV, this project delivers state-of-the-art performance for applications in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and video editing.



# ✨ Key Features
✅ Frame-by-frame segmentation with temporal consistency

✅ Adaptive thresholding for complex backgrounds

✅ GPU acceleration support

✅ Interactive Jupyter notebook for easy experimentation (main_file.ipynb)

✅ Export results as masked videos or PNG sequences
